This repo is the code generated while I have been learning typescript (on the backend) and
redux (on the frontend).  It forms a user management service that I was going to expand into
something else when I got some inspiration...

It should be considered development code only.......

# Installation

## Backend
```
cd backend/user
npm install
npm run dev
```
## Frontend
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

# Usage

Frontend script will fire up a Chrome session.  For admin rights use the default user bob@example.com (password 12345678).

# TODO

Lots more testing - particularly frontend.
